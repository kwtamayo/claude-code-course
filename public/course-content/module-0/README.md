# Module 0: Clean Slate Setup

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** None - this is the starting point!

## Overview

Welcome to the Claude Code Course! This module ensures everyone starts from the same baseline by:

1. Scanning your current development environment
2. Identifying potential conflicts
3. Safely removing conflicting tools
4. Installing exactly what you need for this course

## Why Start Fresh?

You might already have development tools installed. That's great! But different versions, configurations, or conflicting installations can cause mysterious errors that waste hours of debugging time.

By starting with a clean slate, we ensure:
- ✅ Everyone has the same setup
- ✅ Instructions work reliably
- ✅ No "it works on my machine" problems
- ✅ You learn the proper installation process

## What You'll Learn

- How to check what's installed on your Mac
- Using the command line (Terminal)
- Understanding package managers (Homebrew)
- Safe uninstallation procedures
- Setting up development tools from scratch
